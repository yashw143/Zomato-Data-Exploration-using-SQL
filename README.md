# Zomato-Data-Exploration-using-SQL

My project involved cleaning and exploring the Zomato dataset using SQL techniques such as joins, subqueries, and ranking. Through my analysis, I was able to uncover valuable insights from the data, which provided meaningful information for making data-driven decisions. Overall, 
my project showcases the power of SQL in extracting insights from messy datasets.


Insights derived from the Data Set
---What is the total amount each customer spent on zomato?

-- How many days has each customer visited zomato?

--what was the first product purchased by each customer?

--what is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

--which item was the most popular for each customer?

--which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

-- which item was purchased just before the customer became a  member

--what is the total orders and amount spent for each menber before they beacame a member?

--if buying each product generates point for eg 5rs=2 zomato point each product has different purchasing points

--for eg for p1 5rs=1 zomato point, for p2 10rs=5zomato point and p3 5rs=1 zomato point

-- calculate points collected by each customers and for which product most points have been given till now.

--In the first one year after a customer joins the gold program (including their join date) irrespective of what the customer

--has purchase they earn 5 zomato points for every 10rs spent who earned more 1 or 3

--and what was their points earnings in their first yr?
--1 zp=2rs
--0.5 zp= 1rs

--rank all the transaction for each memeber whenever they are a zomato gold member for every non gold member transacction mark as na
